# Very-simple-Gate-Geant4-installation
+ I have released the first script that can help you install Geant4, Root, and the required packages automatically. It available at: https://github.com/HungBuiTien/Very-simple-Gate-Geant4-installation ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
+ I tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 18.x. But I strongly recommend it will operate effectly on Ubuntu 20.04.
+ I will update the next version in the near future.
+ You can download the script via git commands:
git clone https://github.com/HungBuiTien/Very-simple-Gate-Geant4-installation.git
+ To run the script, let try
yes | ./auto_g4.sh
It will create a "Softwares" folder. Everything will be installed here.
You only need to enter your passwords when required.
+ Please tell me your felling after using the script. If you have any problem, please let me know via my email.
